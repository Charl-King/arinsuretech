# Projects Created by Makers üî•
### [Make AR Face](https://bitbucket.org/Echochi/make-ar-face)
_By [@corrie](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9MCSKB9U) and [@shenine](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9LECL4Q3)_  
This is a project file which contains scripts from XZIMG which does facial recognition and AR mapping. It has a sample scene file which fits face masks on up to 3 people and glasses on the first person matched.

### [ARInsureTech](https://github.com/Akahadaka/ARInsureTech)
_By [@nash](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9LQD9TMK)_  
When a user introduces Cozmo's cube to the scene, an insurance quote should pop up, giving the opportunity to insure the precious cube against theft or damage for x per month.

### [AR-Unity-Vuforia-Card-Matching](https://github.com/giliomeejg/AR-Unity-Vuforia-Card-Matching)
_By [@gerrit](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U8VB829BJ) and [@riaan](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UBGB8GT7A)_  
2 Cards representing mobile phones are used to make a call to root.co.za insurance API to obtain insurance quotes and display the results over the card.

### [Deathcard](https://github.com/AngusTheMack/deathcard)
_By [@rozanne](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9WNZ7C74) and [@angus](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UC6JH787K)_  
Rozanne de Jager and I created this application during the Build an AR app on Root Insurance course, at Make by OfferZen. It was a great day, and doing work with Augmented Reality is so tangible and cool. You can take a look at the video of the project [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kNBLJUVC2TgRWWfY7).

### [Text Editor](https://bitbucket.org/waydemlyle/makeday/src/master/)
_By [@wayde](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9K82LR7D) and [@Brendon Pitcher](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UC8F5853R)_  
A text editor which spits out files in AR and allows you to edit them, still a WIP.

### [Card Protection Game](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/files/UCB4MAGAF/FCCB71543/archive.zip)
_By [@Denzil Buchner](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UCB4MAGAF) and [@rohan.buchner](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@U9QECBU1Z)_  
The idea is to allow each player to scan 3 cards, and insure it against "fire" or "lightning" - basically setting up each card as an insurance policy against each thread. Its up to the player to remember what he assigned to each card. After both players assigned their cards, as instructed by the game, it will randomly chooses the next "threat" and the player has to play their policy to protect against the threat. If they dont have the right policy (or played the wrong one), they lose. WIP. You can download the project.

### [Make Day Work](https://github.com/nickidebruyn/makedaywork)
_By [@Nicki De Bruyn](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UCB82PWBD)_

### [Car Crash](https://github.com/Regan-Koopmans/arinsuretech-carcrash)
_By [@Regan](https://offerzen-make.slack.com/messages/@UCDTWU2T0)_  
This project detects two image targets and renders 3D cars in an AR scene. When they collide and crash into each other, smoke pours out of the car hoods. Then a Root API request could be made, to process an insurance claim.
